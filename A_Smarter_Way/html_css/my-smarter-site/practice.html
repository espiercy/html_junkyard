	<p>Leading style manuals say book titles, like <i>David Copperfield</i>, should be italicized.</p>
	<p>You must be dressed <em>and</em> ready to go.

	<h3 class="emphasized">This has been emphasized using css</h3>
	<p><i>Italics</i> can be <em>implemented</em> in two different ways, <b>and</b> so can <strong>bold</strong></p>
	<p>This next text is <span class="emphasized">emphasized class-wise</span> so it appears in italics</p>

	<h4>This header 4 ought to have text smushed together</h4>
	<h5>Given my h5's more space between words</h5>
	<p class="more-readable">This paragraph is more readable because I have increased its line-height</p>
	<p class="pretty">As the text in this paragraph is of class "pretty", it shall appear justified. This was accomplished by setting the 'text-align' property to justify, as in "text-align: justify;". However, as the space inside of the browser window is fairly massive, demonstrating that the rows of text are all evenly placed and not at all ragged on the righthand side would require a paragraph of considerable length. This paragraph is such an attempt at an overly large field of text, and must be long enough so that it can reasonably stretch at least two rows within the browser (though admittedly, more would be very useful in this demonstration, so we will make every attempt to continue entering text into this paragraph, despite how mind-numbing the task really is. On the other hand, sometimes it is not awful to have mindless tasks that need doing. Believe it or not, when I initially tested this update it appeared as though the justification didn't occur. Indeed it did not, but that was because I had mispelled the word "align" (I used "algn"). I then set the text to red in order to verify, but realized my error since the text was not faded the same for both properties (because one was not, in fact, a property).</p>
